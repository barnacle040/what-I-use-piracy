## 2026-02-19 - Resource Loading & Asset Normalization
**Learning:** Combining `loading="lazy"` with `fetchpriority="high"` on the same image element creates a priority conflict that can confuse the browser's resource scheduler. Additionally, case-sensitivity in preloads (e.g., `.png` vs `.PNG`) and spaces in filenames are common sources of silent 404s that degrade performance by wasting requests.
**Action:** Always verify that above-the-fold assets are preloaded with correct casing and no lazy loading. Normalize filenames to use underscores and lowercase extensions. Avoid combining lazy loading with high fetch priority.
